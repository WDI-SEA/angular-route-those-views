	<p class="summary_text"><span class="char">A</span>s a full-stack developer living in Seattle, I have a passion for implementing creativity and uniqueness to everything that I do. My artistic ability gives an advantage in front-end web development, while my passion for solving and overcoming challenges gives me an advantage in deploying back-end frameworks. As a marketing graduate from the University of Washington, I understand the product life cycle from procurement to finally delivery. The skills gained from my Media and Communications degree, allow me to implement video and audio production elements within my web pages. These core competencies allow me to code with the consumer in mind and help me deliver a more viable product. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me outdoors enjoying the beautiful Pacific Northwest.

    <h2> Finn the Human </h2>
  </div>
    <p>Finn the Human (voiced by Jeremy Shada in the TV series, Zack Shada in the original pilot short where his name was Pen) is a human boy who loves nothing more than going on adventures and saving the day. He wears a hat that covers his extremely long flowing golden hair. He is prone to exclamations and outbursts including "Mathematical!" and "Algebraic!" When Finn was a baby, he was abandoned and subsequently adopted by Jake's parents, Joshua and Margaret, as detailed in "Memories of Boom Boom Mountain". Considering himself a hero, Finn has a lust for adventure and swore long ago that he would help anyone in need, but being so full of energy, he has trouble in situations that require him to do tasks other than fighting. After initially having an unrequited crush on Princess Bubblegum, Finn began a relationship with Flame Princess that lasted until the events of "Frost and Fire". In "Billy's Bucket List", it is revealed that Finn's birth father, Martin, is alive, and is trapped in a dimension known as the Citadel, which is a prison for the most dangerous criminals in the Multiverse. The actions of Finn and Jake, along with those of the Lich, cause Martin to be released; Finn soon learns that he is a petty criminal, and in the ensuing chaos, Finn loses his arm, but later regains it in "Breezy". The grass sword curse later re-manifests itself in the sixth season finale, "The Comet", wherein Finn also learns that his spirit is one in the same as a the catalyst comet.</p>

  <h2>Jake the Dog</h2>
    </div>
  <p>Jake the Dog (voiced by John DiMaggio) is Finn's best friend and adoptive brother. He is a 28-year-old—in "magical dog years"—shape-shifting bulldog. The episode "Joshua and Margaret Investigations" reveals that when Joshua and Margaret—Finn and Jake's parents—were on an investigation, Joshua was bitten by some sort of shape-shifting, other-worldly entity. Joshua, infected by the creature's venom, subsequently birthed Jake from his head, resulting in a puppy with the magical ability to shape-shift at will. Jake's magic powers allow him to stretch or shrink any part of his body to any shape and almost any size, ranging from becoming gigantic to becoming incredibly small. His powers help Finn considerably in combat and transportation, but are also sometimes used as nothing more than jovial forms of expression. Acting as a confidant and mentor to his energetic brother—though he has a tendency to give rather questionable advice—Jake has a laid-back attitude in most situations, but loves adventure and will eagerly fight when he needs to do so. Jake is in a relationship with Lady Rainicorn, and they have five children together as seen in the episode "Jake the Dad". The two were drawn to each other due to their shared interest in playing the viola.</p>

  <h2>Princess Bubble Gum</h2>
  </div>
  <p>Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch in the TV series, Isabella Acres when turned younger, Paige Moss in the original pilot short) is a bubblegum humanoid, comparable to the inhabitants of the Candy Kingdom which she rules. The official series website has described her as "a millionaire nerd enthusiast [who] immerses herself in every branch of geekdom".She and Finn have a complex relationship. For the longest time Finn had a crush on Bubblegum, and although she cares for him a great deal, she did not return his feelings for her. In the episode "What was Missing," it is implied that she and Marceline may have had some sort of relationship in the past. This later caused an internet controversy over her and Marceline's sexual orientation. In the second season finale "Mortal Recoil", after being possessed by The Lich, she was accidentally shattered and returned to life as a 13-year-old due to the doctors' not having enough gum to rebuild her to her proper age, though it appears that her memories have remained intact. In the episode "Too Young", she becomes 18 again by absorbing the parts sacrificed by her candy subjects in order to reclaim her kingdom from the Earl of Lemongrab. After her brush with death, she has begun to feel more and more vulnerable. As a result, she created the clone-Sphinx named Goliad to serve as her heir lest she die on the throne. During the fifth and sixth seasons, it was gradually revealed that Bubblegum had an elaborate spy network, allowing her to monitor nearly everyone in Ooo. After growing increasingly darker and more devious, Bubblegum's Machiavellian actions were finally confronted by Flame Princess in "The Cooler", and since then Bubblegum has made a concerted effort to relax her need to control everything. In the two-part sixth season finale, Bubblegum is peacefully deposed after the candy citizens vote to replace her with the King of Ooo (voiced by Andy Daly). Rather than fight her rival, Bubblegum willingly goes into exile with Peppermint Butler until returning to the Candy Kingdom in the aftermath of the Stakes miniseries.</p>

  
  <div class="text-center">
  <h2>BMO</h2>
  </div>
  <p>BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), sometimes written phonetically as Beemo, is a sentient video game console-shaped robot that lives with Finn and Jake. BMO is neither male nor female. In the show both the pronoun "he" and the term "m'lady" have been used in reference to BMO. Its appearance has been compared to a "Game Boy and Macintosh mashup". BMO also has the features of other household objects, such as a portable electrical outlet, music player, camera, alarm clock, flashlight, strobe light, and video player. While BMO is an object used for recreation by Finn and Jake, it is still considered a close friend and treated as an equal by the two. BMO speaks English with a Korean accent. In the episode "Five Short Graybles", it was revealed that BMO secretly emulates a discussion between a mirrored version of itself which it names "Football" and pretends to be human while teaching Football human habits by attempting to imitate them such as brushing its teeth and using the toilet. BMO was created by Moseph Mastro "Moe" Giovanni, an inventor of robots who created the entire MO line, a thousand years before the events of the series. Though he created millions of robots, Giovanni specifically created BMO to understand fun; Giovanni invented him to help him raise his own son, but because he never had kids, he released BMO to find another family.</p>

  <h2>Marceline</h2>
  </div>
  <p>Marceline the Vampire Queen (voiced by Olivia Olson, Ava Acres when younger, Cloris Leachman when older) is a half-human and half-demon vampire, and the eponymous Vampire Queen, after having killed the previous Vampire King, as seen in Stakes. Although she is over a thousand years old, she appears in the form of a young adult. She is usually shown playing her axe bass, which was formerly her family's heirloom battle axe. Marceline and her father, Hunson Abadeer, have trouble accepting one another. Initially, Marceline feels that her father does not care for her and expresses her feelings through music. Furthermore, Abadeer constantly pressures Marceline to follow in the family business and take over ruling the Nightosphere, a prospective job Marceline does not want. Marceline and the Ice King also have a complicated relationship. In the episode "I Remember You", it is revealed that the Ice King—then, the human man named Simon Petrikov—befriended Marceline during the aftermath of the Mushroom War.</p>

  <div class="text-center">
  <h2>Lumpy Space Princess</h2>
  </div>
  <p>Lumpy Space Princess (voiced by Pendleton Ward), often abbreviated as LSP, is the princess of Lumpy Space, an alternate dimension.[14] As a "Lumper", made out of "irradiated stardust", she can convert other beings into Lumpers by biting them. LSP is spoiled and sarcastic, and is often shown living outdoors with salvaged furniture and appears to be homeless, because she has run away from her parents, who are the king and queen of Lumpy Space. She speaks with a thick Valley Girl Accent. LSP's relationship to Finn and Jake has always come off as nonchalant, but in the episode "Gotcha", LSP realizes that Finn is a person of good moral standing who teaches her that beauty comes from the inside, and in her premiere episode, she reveals to Finn that he's supposed to be her real friend, not like the "fake" ones she has in Lumpy Space.</p>

   <div class="text-center">
  <h2>Lady Rainicorn</h2>
  </div>
  <p>Lady Rainicorn (voiced by Niki Yang in the TV series, Dee Bradley Baker in the original pilot short) is a Rainicorn, a half-rainbow half-unicorn creature, as well as Jake's girlfriend and Princess Bubblegum's companion. She can turn objects and people different colors, and she can fly because her body intercepts light and can "dance" on it, which also explains her movement and why she has a rainbow pattern. Her origins can be traced back according to the episode "Her Parents" in which Jake explains how Rainicorns and dogs had been battling over territory in the Crystal Dimension for centuries. The episode also alludes to Rainicorns having a taste for human flesh, when her parents attempt to eat Finn. In the pilot short, she makes pigeon-like sounds to communicate, but in the series, she speaks Korean. Jake and Lady's relationship is a serious one, and in the end of the episode "Lady and Peebles", it was revealed that Lady was pregnant. In "Jake the Dad", Lady bears five puppies with Jake: Charlie, T.V., Viola, Kim Kil Whan, and Jake Jr.</p>
   <div class="text-center">
  <h2>Flame Princess</h2>
  </div>
  <p>Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), whose first name is Phoebe, is the 16-year-old princess of the Fire Kingdom, the daughter of the Flame King, and is one of Finn's friends. Like all other inhabitants of the Fire Kingdom, she is covered with fire, the very flames emitted from her body being extensions of herself that intensify when she becomes emotionally excited. While she was initially referred to as being destructive by her own father, she has a more naïve nature that prompts her to act on her emotions. Finn describes her as "passionate". When she was a toddler, her father attempted to exile her to Ooo out of fear that she would one day usurp the throne, but when Princess Bubblegum returned her, he locked her up instead. In the episode "Ignition Point" after asking Finn to retrieve candles from the Fire Kingdom, she inadvertently expressed her dislike of her father; this largely stems from her imprisonment. Eventually, Flame Princess begins to question herself, and doubts whether or not she is in fact evil. Finn is insistent that she is not evil and takes her on a journey into a dungeon to help her sort out her thoughts. Flame Princess comes to the conclusion that, while she is a lover of destruction, she only enjoys destroying bad guys. Flame Princess and Finn began a relationship sometime before the events of "Burning Low" However, in the episode "Frost and Fire", she breaks up with Finn after he inadvertently insults her in an attempt to get her and the Ice King to fight each other. Confused by her feelings, she overthrows her father as king and installs a new government and outlaws lies of any kind. She forgives Finn for what he did to her, allows him to visit any time, but declines his offer to rekindle their romantic relationship.</p>

    <div class="text-center">
  <h2>Ice King</h2>
  </div>
  <p>Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny in the TV series, John Kassir in the original pilot short) is a recurring antagonist of the series, and is 1,043 years old. The Ice King frequently steals princesses throughout Ooo to forcefully marry them, Princess Bubblegum being his usual target.[14] His ice-based magic abilities come from a magical crown he wears, which directly causes his insanity. The sixth season episode "Evergreen" reveals that the crown was created millions of years prior to the start of the series by an ice elemental named Evergreen in order to stop a comet from destroying all life on the planet. Though Ice King is defined as completely crazy by many, he is actually lonely and misunderstood, having a generally benevolent relationship with the penguins of his realm. Furthermore, he is secretly envious of Finn and Jake for being such good friends. Finn and Jake learned during the events of "Holly Jolly Secrets" that the Ice King was originally a human antiquarian named Simon Petrikov who bought his crown from a dock worker in northern Scandinavia, predating the Mushroom War. Wearing the crown, Petrikov began to lose both his mind and then his fiancée Betty; this explains his subconscious need for princesses. He soon began deteriorating in both mind and body over the years into his current state.[62] Sometime before the Mushroom War he also discovered the Enchiridion. 996 years before the events of the series and directly after the Mushroom War, he met, befriended, and took care of young Marceline. Eventually, he realized that his deteriorating mind and behavior would possibly become a threat to young Marceline. Thus, he wrote a letter to Marceline, describing why he could not help her anymore and imploring her to forgive him for whatever wrong he might do with the crown possessing him.</p>

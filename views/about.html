		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Muse are an English rock band from Teignmouth, Devon, formed in 1994. The band consists of Matt Bellamy (lead vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), Chris Wolstenholme (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Dominic Howard (drums, percussion).</p>
		<p>Muse released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, showcasing an aggressive and melancholic style. Their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), expanded their sound, combining Bellamy's falsetto, heavier riffs, wider instrumentation, and romantic classical influences. It earned them mainstream European success and a reputation for energetic live performances. Their third album, Absolution (2003), saw further classical influences, incorporating orchestra on tracks such as "Butterflies and Hurricanes", and brought American success, producing hit singles including "Time is Running Out".</p>

		<p>Muse's fourth album, Black Holes and Revelations (2006), incorporated electronic and pop elements, influenced by 80s groups such as Depeche Mode. The Resistance (2009) and The 2nd Law (2012) explore lyrical themes of government oppression and uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts. Their seventh album, Drones (2015), is a concept album about drone warfare and returns to a harder rock sound.</p>

		<p>Muse have won numerous music awards including five MTV Europe Music Awards, eight NME Awards, two Brit Awards, and two Grammy Awards from seven nominations, winning Best Rock Album for The Resistance and Drones. They have sold more than 20 million albums worldwide.</p>

<h1>About Groove Merchant</h1>
<div class="container">
	<p class="col-xs-6 text-justify">Opened by Ubiquity Records boss Michael McFadin back in 1990, Groove Merchant was originally part of Rooky Ricardo’s legendary Haight Street record store. The shop has cycled through owners and locations and today is back on Haight, right across the road from Ricardo’s. Now owned by Chris Veltri, the neighbourhood institution – whose name is a nod to the ’70s jazz and RnB label – is undoubtedly Fog City’s premier collector’s shop. Come here for jaw-dropping jazz originals, Latin-galore, folk-funk, heavy hip-hop and boogie gems. No digging required! The shop might look tiny next to Haight-Ashbury’s imposing Amoeba Records, but every inch of its cosy 700-square-footage has been put to good use. With a dedicated listening deck and friendly, clued-up staff, don’t expect to leave this place empty handed.</p>

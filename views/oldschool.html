<p> Old school rap (1979–84) was "easily identified by its relatively simple raps" according to AllMusic, "the emphasis was not on lyrical technique, but simply on good times", one notable exception being Melle Mel, who set the way for future rappers through his socio-political content and creative wordplay.

Golden age hip hop (the mid-1980s to early '90s) was the time period where hip-hop lyricism went through its most drastic transformation – writer William Jelani Cobb says "in these golden years, a critical mass of mic prodigies were literally creating themselves and their art form at the same time" and Allmusic writes, "rhymers like PE's Chuck D, Big Daddy Kane, KRS-One, and Rakim basically invented the complex wordplay and lyrical kung-fu of later hip-hop". The golden age is considered to have ended around 1993–94, marking the end of rap lyricism's most innovative period.

<p>Old school hip hop is said to have ended around 1984 due to changes in both rapping technique and the accompanying music and rhythms.
</p>
<p>The image, styles and sounds of the old school were exemplified by figures like Afrika Bambaataa, The Sugarhill Gang, Grandmaster Flash, Rock Steady Crew, Spoonie Gee, Newcleus, Treacherous Three, Funky Four Plus One, Kurtis Blow, Busy Bee Starski, Lovebug Starski, The Cold Crush Brothers, Kool Moe Dee, Warp 9 and Fab Five Freddy It is characterized by the simpler rapping techniques of the time and the general focus on party related subject matter There were however, exceptions, such as Brother D's "How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise", and Kurtis Blow's "Hard Times", (both released in 1980) that explored socially relevant ideas. The release of The Message in 1982 by Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five marked the arrival of hip hop as social commentary, making it possible for future artists like Public Enemy and N.W.A to create an identity based on socially conscious themes

<p>Musical characteristics and themes[e
Old-school hip hop is noted for its relatively simple rapping techniques compared to later hip-hop music Artists such as Melle Mel would use few syllables per bar of music with simple rhythms and a moderate tempo
</p>
<p>Much of the subject matter of old school hip hop centers around partying and having a good time In the book How to Rap, Immortal Technique explains how party content played a big part in old school hip hop: "hip-hop was born in an era of social turmoil... in the same way that slaves used to sing songs on a plantation... that's the party songs that we used to have" As mentioned earlier, a notable exception is the song "The Message", which was written by Melle Mel for his hip hop group, Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five the song was a hit and introduced social commentary to hip hop.
</p>
<p>Battle rap was also a part of the old school hip hop aesthetic. While discussing battle rapping, Esoteric said, "a lot of my stuff stems from old school hip-hop, braggadocio ethic" A famous old school hip hop battle occurred in December 1981 when Kool Moe Dee challenged Busy Bee Starski Busy Bee Starski's defeat by the more complex raps of Kool Moe Dee meant that "no longer was an MC just a crowd-pleasing comedian with a slick tongue; he was a commentator and a storyteller" KRS-One also credits this as creating a shift in rapping in the documentary Beef

Sci-Fi/ Afrofuturism was another theme introduced into hip hop. The release of Planet Rock in 1982 was a game changer, like "a light being switched on."  The combination of electronic percussive propulsion and Afrika Bambaataa's rap sounded like "an orchestra being rocketed into outer space." Light Years Away, by Warp 9, (1983) produced and written by Lotti Golden and Richard Scher, explored social commentary from a Sci-Fi perspective. A "cornerstone of early 80's beatbox afrofuturism," Light Years Away, is characterized as "a brilliantly spare and sparse piece of electro hip-hop traversing inner and outer space."
